# A Tour of GO

You can do the tour by yourself through its [official website](https://tour.golang.org/list)!

Basically, you'll find here the same code presented to you within the tour, maybe with some enhancements, overall the same, though.

## How did I start this project?

As I use `nvm`, `rbenv`, `pyenv`, and similars, I found one with the same purpose called `goenv` (know more how I handle them looking at my [personal-environment](https://github.com/willianantunes/personal-environment/blob/cc47a0b0b73f6f0fede12ebb7c09bca40aa3122c/src/scripts/languages_and_related_tools.sh#L26) repository).

After installing the latest version of Go, I just issued the following command:

```shell
go mod init github.com/willianantunes/a-tour-of-go
```

Then I could start the tour!
